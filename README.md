## Repository Content
This repository contains the following directories: 

* **presentations** - Slides for presentations given by participants in the course. 
* **documentation** - Directory where etiquette and collaboration guidance is provided.
* **projects** - Directory where course projects and supplementary material are described. 


This course trains students to build semantically interoperable systems using the full Semantic Web stack, automated reasoning, and ontology-based machine learning workflows. Each week blends theoretical grounding with hands-on practice. Final projects will demonstrate students’ ability to model, query, validate, and augment knowledge using formal ontologies and AI.
