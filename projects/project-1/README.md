# Week 1 Project: Tooling Check-In

The purpose of this week is to ensure that your development environment is correctly set up and that you are comfortable with the core workflow of the course:

- Using **Git & GitHub** to manage code.
- Running **Jupyter notebooks** for semantic web tasking.
- Installing and importing required libraries.
- Parsing RDF data with `rdflib`.
- Submitting your work via GitHub, with **automated grading** verifying your setup.

## Some Tools of the Tradecraft

- **Git & GitHub**  
  Git is a version control system that tracks changes to your files over time, and GitHub provides a cloud-based platform for collaboration. In this course, you will use GitHub to store your work, submit assignments, and review peers’ projects. 

- **Jupyter Notebooks**  
  Jupyter notebooks let you combine code, results, and documentation in one file. We will use them extensively to experiment with RDF, SPARQL, OWL reasoning, and SHACL validation. Notebooks make it easy to demonstrate semantic web workflows and share reproducible analyses.

- **Python Libraries**  
  Python libraries such as `rdflib`, `SPARQLWrapper`, and `pyshacl` provide the core functionality for working with ontologies and RDF data. Every project in the course will depend on at least one such library.  

- **Automated Grading**  
  Each time you push your work to GitHub, an automated grading pipeline (via GitHub Actions) will run tests on your submission. This ensures your code executes correctly, your RDF parses, and your notebook runs without errors.
