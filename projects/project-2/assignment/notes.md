### thoughts ###

 - the autograder didn't seem to *do* anything when i push or pull, but i don't know if it's supposed to interact with me. i'll trust it's ok
 - creating a core and instances ttl file; readme indicates i'll need others. not confident in what should go where, besides bfo in core, instances
 - a modules subdirectory is mentioned in the guidance section, can't find it in the tree here
